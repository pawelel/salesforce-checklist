# checklist

This project is a simple checklist app that allows users to help in routine tasks with Salesforce. The app is built using Flutter and Dart.

There are 2 modes: new case and old case. The difference is that in new case mode, when user selects all checkboxes, the app will increment case counter. In old case mode, the 
app will not increment case counter, Reset button will be renamed to Clear.
